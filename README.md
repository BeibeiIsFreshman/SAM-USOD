Please criticize and correct me. I will reply to your message as soon as possible.

The USOD10k training set can be downloaded from the publisher of USOD10k. “USOD10K: A New Benchmark Dataset for Underwater Salient Object Detection”

The SAM fine-tuning framework is available on the release site of MDSAM. “Multi-Scale and Detail-Enhanced Segment Anything Model for Salient Object Detection”

The weights will be uploaded in a timely manner once the paper is accepted.

Due to the limited equipment of our model, SAM_B can only be trained at 320 x 320 and SAM_L can only be trained at 224 x 224. If you have good equipment to reproduce this code and get better weights, such as using a higher size or a more powerful SAM original weight.
